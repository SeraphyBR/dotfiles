#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 1800

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended a it can slow down resizing of the terminal and also
#: use large amounts of RAM.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

url_color #7FFF00
url_style single

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

open_url_modifiers none

#: The modifier keys to press when clicking with the mouse on URLs to
#: open the URL

open_url_with qutebrowser

#: The program with which to open URLs that are clicked on. The
#: special value default means to use the operating system's default
#: URL handler.

# rectangle_select_modifiers ctrl+alt

#: The modifiers to use rectangular selection (i.e. to select text in
#: a rectangular block with the mouse)

# select_by_word_characters :@-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alpha-numeric character in the unicode database will be matched.

# click_interval 0.5

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds)

# mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.

# focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.
 
sync_to_monitor no

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  no
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. For a list of available
#: layouts, see the
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#layouts.

# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing
#: and the lines value for vertical resizing.

# window_border_width 1.0

#: The width (in pts) of window borders. Will be rounded to the
#: nearest number of pixels based on screen resolution. Note that
#: borders are displayed only when more than one window is visible.
#: They are meant to separate multiple windows.

# draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.

# window_margin_width 0.0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border)

# single_window_margin_width -1000.0

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead.

# window_padding_width 0.0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border)

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

#: Tab bar {{{

# tab_bar_edge bottom

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts)

# tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of: fade or separator. In the fade
#: style, each tab's edges fade into the background color, in the
#: separator style, tabs are separated by a configurable separator.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " â”‡"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# active_tab_foreground   #000

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Clipboard {{{

map kitty_mod+c  copy_to_clipboard
map kitty_mod+v  paste_from_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection
# map kitty_mod+o  pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, for example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: }}}

#: Scrolling {{{

# map kitty_mod+up        scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+k         scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+down      scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+j         scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+page_up   scroll_page_up
# map kitty_mod+page_down scroll_page_down
# map kitty_mod+home      scroll_home
# map kitty_mod+end       scroll_end
# map kitty_mod+h         show_scrollback

#: You can pipe the contents of the current screen + history buffer as
#: STDIN to an arbitrary program using the ``pipe`` function. For
#: example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in less in an
#: overlay window::

#:     map f1 pipe @ansi overlay less +G -R

#: Placeholders available are: @text (which is plain text) and @ansi
#: (which includes text styling escape codes). For only the current
#: screen, use @screen or @ansi_screen. For the secondary screen, use
#: @alternate and @ansi_alternate. The secondary screen is the screen
#: not currently displayed. For example if you run a fullscreen
#: terminal application, the secondary screen will be the screen you
#: return to when quitting the application. You can also use ``none``
#: for no STDIN input.

#: To open in a new window, tab or new OS window, use ``window``,
#: ``tab``, or ``os_window`` respectively. You can also use ``none``
#: in which case the data will be piped into the program without
#: creating any windows, useful if the program is a GUI program that
#: creates its own windows.

#: }}}

#: Window management {{{

# map kitty_mod+enter new_window

#: You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+y      new_window mutt

#: You can open a new window with the current working directory set to
#: the working directory of the current window using::

#:     map ctrl+alt+enter    new_window_with_cwd

#: You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via the
#: kitty remote control facility by prefixing the command line with @.
#: Any programs running in that window will be allowed to control
#: kitty. For example::

#:     map ctrl+enter new_window @ some_program

# map kitty_mod+n new_os_window
# map kitty_mod+w close_window
# map kitty_mod+] next_window
# map kitty_mod+[ previous_window

# map kitty_mod+.     move_tab_forward
# map kitty_mod+,     move_tab_backward
# map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title

#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and use
#: new_tab_with_cwd. Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to
#: the current tab rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]
#: }}}

#: Layout management {{{

# map kitty_mod+l next_layout

#: You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific layouts::

#:     map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
#:     map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

#: Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout::

#:    map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout
#: }}}

#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty windows at a
#: time or only the current one.

map kitty_mod+equal     change_font_size all +1.0
map kitty_mod+minus     change_font_size all -1.0
map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size all 0

#: To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current window's font size::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

# map kitty_mod+e kitten hints

#: Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#: to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#: Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful, for
#: instance to run git commands on a filename output from a previous
#: git command.

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#: Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#: Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for the
#: output of things like: ls -1

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#: Select words and insert into terminal.

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#: Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#: terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#: commits


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.
